# Functions-Flagons
JS COYA Game (unfinished)


Functions & Flagons is a JavaScript based game that I made in JSBin some time ago.  I've copied the code, in its entirety, straight out of JSBin and saved it on my hard drive.  I never quite got the game to work, and (fair warning) it uses *ALERT* for all of its output, so it can be rather annoying.

If you want to mess with it, I'd recommend just copypasta'ing it into an empty JSBin.

Still, I thought it'd be great to put it up here, as it's one of the first things I ever made that kinda worked.
